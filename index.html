She was a prominent leading actress and was often cast as the second heroine during the 1980s era. She's also a director and producer now.After marrying her co-star-turned-husband Rajasekhar in 1991, Jeevitha chose to completely step away from the limelight of acting and further focus on her marriage and family. Instead, she became a backbone of strength to support her husband’s acting career. She later became a director and producer for Rajasekhar’s films, many of which are remakes.</p>
